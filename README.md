# 1990 California House Value Prediction

This project is a modified interpretation and implementation of the *End-to-End Machine Learning Project* in Chapter 2 of the book **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** by Aurelien Geron [1]. When compared to the original notebook, there are  changes, varied observations and rearrangement of sections at my own discretion. 

Here, we aim to build a machine learning model that performs the supervised univariate multiple regression task of predicting the price of a house based on a set of features obtained through the 1990 California census. 

The dataset used is a slight modification (see [2] for modifications) of the original California Housing Prices Dataset from the Statlib repository [3].
